# Gaming Asset Marketplace

## Project Description

The Gaming Asset Marketplace is a decentralized platform built on Ethereum that enables players to mint, trade, and transfer gaming assets as NFTs across multiple supported games. This smart contract creates a unified ecosystem where in-game items can retain their value and utility beyond individual games, fostering true ownership of digital gaming assets.

The platform implements a sophisticated rarity system (Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary, Mythic) that influences both minting costs and asset value. Players can seamlessly transfer their valuable assets between compatible games, creating an interconnected gaming economy that transcends traditional game boundaries.

## Project Vision
